This demo implements a digit span task in PsychoPy in which responses are recorded through a mouse click. Visual feedback is provided to confirm that each digit click has been registered. PsychoPy must be installed on your device for this to run. The online counterpart on this (through Pavlovia) is still not working due to error in the js code.
